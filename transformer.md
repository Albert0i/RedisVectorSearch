## Multiple Layers and Self-Attention Mechanism in Transformers


### Multiple Layers

A transformer model like BERT is composed of multiple layers, each of which contains a series of neural network components designed to process and refine the input data. Here's a breakdown of these components:

1. **Embedding Layer**: This is the initial layer where tokens are converted into dense vectors (embeddings).

2. **Transformer Layers**: These are the core layers of the model, and BERT has 12 to 24 transformer layers stacked on top of each other. Each transformer layer consists of two main parts:
   - **Self-Attention Mechanism**
   - **Feed-Forward Network**


### Self-Attention Mechanism

The self-attention mechanism is a key part of the transformer model that allows it to capture the context of each token within the sentence. Here's how it works:

1. **Attention Scores Calculation**:
   - For each token in the sentence, the self-attention mechanism calculates attention scores with respect to every other token. These scores indicate the relevance or importance of other tokens to the current token.
   - For example, in the sentence "I like apple", the model calculates how relevant "like" and "apple" are to the token "I".

2. **Query, Key, and Value Vectors**:
   - Each token's embedding is transformed into three vectors: Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V) vectors.
   - The attention score between two tokens is calculated as the dot product of their Query and Key vectors, followed by a softmax function to normalize the scores.

3. **Weighted Sum**:
   - The Value vectors of all tokens are weighted by their corresponding attention scores. The result is a new representation of the token that incorporates information from all other tokens in the sentence.

4. **Multi-Head Attention**:
   - The self-attention mechanism uses multiple attention heads to capture different aspects of the relationships between tokens. Each head independently performs the attention mechanism and the results are concatenated and linearly transformed.


### Feed-Forward Network

After the self-attention mechanism, each token's new representation is passed through a feed-forward network, which consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between:

1. **First Linear Transformation**: Projects the token's representation to a higher-dimensional space.
2. **ReLU Activation**: Applies a non-linear transformation to introduce non-linearity.
3. **Second Linear Transformation**: Projects the token's representation back to the original dimensionality.


### Layer Normalization and Residual Connections

Each transformer layer also includes layer normalization and residual connections to stabilize and accelerate training:

1. **Residual Connections**: Adds the input of the layer to the output of the layer, helping to preserve information from the previous layer.
2. **Layer Normalization**: Normalizes the output of the layer to improve training stability.


### Summary

In summary, here's the flow of data through the multiple layers of a transformer model like BERT:

1. **Tokenization**: Split the input sentence into tokens.
2. **Embedding Layer**: Convert tokens into dense vectors (embeddings).
3. **Multiple Transformer Layers**:
   - **Self-Attention Mechanism**: Capture the context of each token by calculating attention scores and combining information from other tokens.
   - **Feed-Forward Network**: Refine the token representations through linear transformations and non-linear activations.
   - **Layer Normalization and Residual Connections**: Stabilize and improve training.
4. **Pooling**: Combine the token embeddings into a single vector representing the entire sentence.


### Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. Tokenization

The input sentence "I like apple" is tokenized into smaller units called tokens:
- Sentence: "I like apple"
- Tokens: ["I", "like", "apple"]

#### 2. Embedding Lookup

Each token is converted into a dense vector (embedding) using an embedding matrix. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of each token:
- "I" → [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...]
- "like" → [0.4, 0.5, 0.6, ...]
- "apple" → [0.7, 0.8, 0.9, ...]

#### 3. Contextualization through Transformer Layers

The token embeddings are passed through multiple layers of the transformer model. Each layer consists of two main parts: Self-Attention Mechanism and Feed-Forward Network.

**Self-Attention Mechanism**:
- For each token, the self-attention mechanism calculates attention scores with respect to every other token in the sentence. These scores indicate how much each token should pay attention to the others.
- For example:
  - Attention scores for "I": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...]
  - Attention scores for "like": [0.4, 0.5, 0.6, ...]
  - Attention scores for "apple": [0.7, 0.8, 0.9, ...]
- Each token's embedding is transformed into three vectors: Query (Q), Key (K), and Value (V).
- The attention score between two tokens is calculated as the dot product of their Query and Key vectors, followed by a softmax function to normalize the scores.
- The Value vectors of all tokens are weighted by their corresponding attention scores. This results in a new representation of the token that incorporates information from all other tokens in the sentence.

**Feed-Forward Network**:
- After the self-attention mechanism, each token's new representation is passed through a feed-forward network consisting of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.
- First Linear Transformation: Projects the token's representation to a higher-dimensional space.
- ReLU Activation: Applies a non-linear transformation to introduce non-linearity.
- Second Linear Transformation: Projects the token's representation back to the original dimensionality.

**Layer Normalization and Residual Connections**:
- Residual Connections: Adds the input of the layer to the output of the layer, helping to preserve information from the previous layer.
- Layer Normalization: Normalizes the output of the layer to improve training stability.

#### 4. Aggregation (Pooling) Operation

The contextualized embeddings for all tokens are combined into a single vector representing the entire sentence:
- Common methods include:
  - **Mean Pooling**: Averages the embeddings of all tokens.
  - **Max Pooling**: Takes the maximum value from each dimension of the token embeddings.
  - **CLS Token Pooling**: Uses the embedding of the special [CLS] token.

#### 5. Output Vector

The result of the pooling operation is a single fixed-size vector (e.g., 768 dimensions) that captures the overall semantic meaning of the sentence "I like apple":
- Example Output Vector: [0.2, 0.3, 0.5, 0.4, 0.7, 0.6, ...]

### Summary

1. **Tokenization**: Split "I like apple" into tokens ["I", "like", "apple"].
2. **Embedding Lookup**: Convert tokens into dense vectors.
3. **Contextualization**: Use self-attention and feed-forward networks to understand the context.
4. **Aggregation (Pooling)**: Combine the token embeddings into a single vector.
5. **Output Vector**: The final vector captures the meaning of the entire sentence.

This process allows the transformer model to understand and represent the nuanced meaning of sentences, making it effective for various NLP tasks.
